        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of
            the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that national data protection regulations in your or
            our country of residence or domicile may also apply in addition to the GDPR. If more specific legal bases
            apply in individual cases, we will inform you of these in this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sent. 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their
                consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sent. 1 lit. b)
                    GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
                subject is a party or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a
                contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sent. 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is
                necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party,
                provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
                protection of personal data do not override them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection
            regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes the Federal
            Data Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains special regulations for the right to information, the right to
            deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other
            purposes, and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling.
            State data protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Note on GDPR and Swiss DPA applicability:</strong> These data protection notices serve to provide
            information in accordance with both the Swiss DPA and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For
            this reason, please note that the terms used in the GDPR are applied for broader geographical application
            and understanding. Specifically, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data", "overriding
            interest", and "special categories of personal data" used in the Swiss DPA, the terms "processing" of
            "personal data" and "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" as used in the GDPR are applied.
            The legal meaning of these terms remains determined by the Swiss DPA where applicable.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m27" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Security Measures</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, considering
            the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well
            as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a
            level of security appropriate to the risk.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            These measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
            by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, transfer, securing
            availability, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have procedures in place that ensure the exercise
            of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data vulnerabilities. Moreover, we take
            into account the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software, and
            procedures, following the principle of data protection by design and by default.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Shortening of the IP address:</strong> If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service
            providers we use, and the processing of a complete IP address is not required, the IP address will be
            shortened (also referred to as "IP masking"). This involves removing or replacing the last two digits or the
            last part of the IP address after a dot. The purpose of IP address shortening is to prevent or significantly
            hinder the identification of a person based on their IP address.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS):</strong> To protect the
            data of users that is transmitted through our online services against unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL
            encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of
            secure data transmission over the internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between
            the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), protecting the data from unauthorized
            access. TLS, as the advanced and more secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transfers meet the
            highest security standards. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by
            displaying HTTPS in the URL, signaling to users that their data is being transmitted securely and encrypted.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m25" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            In the course of processing personal data, it may occur that these are transmitted to other entities,
            companies, legally independent organizational units, or individuals or disclosed to them. Recipients of this
            data may include service providers tasked with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are
            integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude
            appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data to protect your data.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m24" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Data processing in third countries:</strong> If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside
            the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if the processing takes place as part of the
            use of services of third parties or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities, or
            companies, this only occurs in accordance with legal requirements. Transfers occur either if the level of
            data protection in the third country has been recognized by the EU Commission (e.g., through an adequacy
            decision under Art. 45 GDPR) or if there are other guarantees such as standard contractual clauses (Art. 46
            para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), explicit consent, or if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract
            or the fulfillment of legal obligations (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Further information on data transfers to third countries can be found in the information provided by the EU
            Commission at: <a

            In addition, as part of the "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the level
            of data protection for certain companies from the USA as secure based on the adequacy decision dated
            10.07.2023. You can find the list of certified companies and further information on the DPF on the website
            of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" class="underline "

        <h2 id="m12" class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal provisions as soon as the underlying
            consent is revoked or there are no longer legal grounds for processing. This applies in cases where the
            original purpose of the processing has ceased or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist
            where statutory obligations or special interests require longer retention or archiving of the data.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal
            prosecution or the protection of the rights of others is stored accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Our data protection information includes additional information on retention and deletion of data,
            specifically for certain processing operations.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If multiple retention or deletion periods are specified, the longest period always applies. If a period does
            not explicitly start on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the
            calendar year in which the event that triggered the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual
            relationships where data is stored, the trigger event is the time of the effectiveness of the termination or
            other end of the legal relationship.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Data that is no longer stored for the originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or other
            reasons is processed solely for the reasons that justify its retention.

                your personal data for such marketing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such

        <p class="mb-4">
            The term "cookies" refers to functions that store and retrieve information on users' devices. Cookies can be
            used for various purposes, such as ensuring the functionality, security, and comfort of online services and
            creating analyses of visitor flows. We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. This includes
            obtaining users' consent in advance, where required. If consent is not required, we rely on our legitimate
            interests, particularly when storage and retrieval of information are necessary to provide explicitly
            requested content and functions. This includes, for example, storing settings and ensuring the functionality
            and security of our online offer. Consent can be revoked at any time. We provide clear information on the
            scope and types of cookies used.

            <strong>Notes on data protection legal bases:</strong> Whether we process personal data using cookies
            depends on consent. If consent is given, it serves as the legal basis. Without consent, we rely on our
            legitimate interests, as explained in this section and in the context of the respective services and

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the device is closed. For
                example, the login status can be stored, and preferred content can be displayed directly when the user
                revisits a website. Likewise, the user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for audience
                measurement. If no explicit information is provided to users about the type and storage duration of
                cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), they should assume that these are permanent and that the
                storage duration may be up to two years.

        <p class="mb-4">
            We send newsletters, emails, and other electronic notifications (hereinafter "Newsletter") only with the
            consent of the recipients or based on a legal basis. If the contents of a newsletter are specifically
            described in the context of registration, they are decisive for the users' consent. For registration to our
            newsletter, it is usually sufficient to provide your email address. However, to provide a personalized
            service, we may ask for your name for personal address in the newsletter or other information necessary for
            the purpose of the newsletter.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Deletion and restriction of processing: We may store the email addresses of unsubscribed users for up to
            three years based on our legitimate interests to provide evidence of previously given consent before
            deleting them. The processing of these data is limited to the purpose of a potential defense against claims.
            An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided that the previous existence of consent is
            confirmed. In the event of obligations to permanently consider objections, we reserve the right to store the
            email address for this purpose alone in a suppression list (so-called "blocklist").

                from their server when the newsletter is opened. As part of this retrieval, technical information such
                as details about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of retrieval, is
                initially collected. This information is used to improve our newsletter based on technical data or the

                using the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether and when
                newsletters are opened and which links are clicked. This information is assigned to individual
                newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until deleted. The evaluations serve to recognize the

            data protection regulations, to the extent that the processing is necessary for providing, conducting, and
            handling the competition, the participants have consented to the processing, or the processing serves our
            legitimate interests (e.g., ensuring the security of the competition or protecting our interests against
            abuse, such as collecting IP addresses when competition entries are submitted).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If participants' entries are published as part of the competition (e.g., as part of a vote or presentation
            of the competition entries or winners or reporting on the competition), we point out that the participants'
            names may also be published in this context. Participants can object to this at any time.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If the competition takes place within an online platform or social network (e.g., Facebook or Instagram,
            hereinafter referred to as "Online Platform"), the terms of use and privacy policies of the respective
            platforms apply in addition. In such cases, we note that we are responsible for the information provided by

            The participants' data will be deleted as soon as the competition or contest is over and the data is no
            longer required to inform the winners or because further inquiries regarding the competition are no longer
            to be expected. In principle, the participants' data will be deleted no later than 6 months after the end of
            the competition. Data of the winners may be retained longer, e.g., to answer inquiries about the prizes or
            to fulfill the prize obligations; in this case, the retention period depends on the type of prize and is,
            e.g., up to three years for goods or services to handle warranty cases. Furthermore, the participants' data
            may be stored longer, e.g., as part of reporting on the competition in online and offline media.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            If data is also collected for other purposes as part of the competition, its processing and retention period

        <p class="mb-4">
            Web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") serves to evaluate the visitor flows of our online
            offer and may include behavior, interests, or demographic information about visitors, such as age or gender,
            as pseudonymous values. Using reach analysis, we can, for example, recognize when our online offer or its
            features or content are used most frequently or invite reuse. It also allows us to identify areas that need
            optimization.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            In addition to web analysis, we may also use testing procedures to test and optimize different versions of
            our online offer or its components.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Unless otherwise specified below, profiles, i.e., data aggregated into a usage process, may be created and
            information may be stored in a browser or on a device and then read. The collected data includes, in
            particular, visited websites and the elements used there, as well as technical information such as the
            browser used, the computer system used, and usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their
            location data, processing of location data is also possible.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            In addition, users' IP addresses are stored. However, we use an IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization
            by shortening the IP address) to protect users. Generally, no clear data (such as email addresses or names)
            of users is stored during web analysis, A/B testing, and optimization, but pseudonyms are used. This means
            that neither we nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the users but only the
            information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective procedures.

        <p class="mb-4">
            We point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union in this process. This can result in

            profiles may, in turn, be used to place advertisements inside and outside the networks that are likely to
            correspond to users' interests. For this purpose, cookies are usually stored on the users' devices, in which
            the usage behavior and interests of the users are stored. The usage profiles may also store data
            independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective
            platforms and logged in).
