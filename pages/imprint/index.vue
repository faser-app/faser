                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Liability for content</strong><br><br>
                The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot assume any liability for the
                correctness, completeness, or up-to-dateness of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible
                for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws as per § 7 Abs.1 TMG. According to §§
                8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
                information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or
                block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this
                regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of
                such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.<br><br>
                <strong>Liability for links</strong><br><br>
                Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, the content of which we have no
                influence on. Therefore, we cannot accept any responsibility for this external content. The respective
                provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked
                pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
                recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
                reasonable without concrete indications of an infringement. If we become aware of any infringements, we
                will remove such links immediately.<br><br>
                <strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.
                Duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization of such material beyond the
                scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator.
                Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the
                content on this site was not created by the operator, third-party copyrights are respected. In
                particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright
                infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such content
                immediately.<br><br>
                <strong>Privacy</strong><br><br>
                The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Where personal data (such
                as name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary
                basis, as far as possible. These data will not be disclosed to third parties without your explicit
                consent.<br>
                We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email)
                can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not
                possible.<br>
                The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of
                sending unsolicited advertisements and information materials is hereby expressly rejected. The operators
                of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited promotional
                information, such as spam emails.<br>
